## Overview

Choolha Chowka is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed to streamline mess management operations for educational institutions and hostels. The platform handles onboarding, payments, meal planning, leave management, and role-based access control dashboards.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Built a scalable multi-tenant system supporting multiple organizations with isolated data and customizable configurations.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: Implemented Celery-Redis queue system for handling background tasks, reducing latency from 5 seconds to under 1 second (99% improvement).
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved 10× throughput improvement through strategic query optimization, Redis caching implementation, and custom observability middleware.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated secure payment gateways for seamless meal plan subscriptions and transactions.
- **RBAC Dashboards**: Developed role-based access control with separate dashboards for administrators, mess managers, and students.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized queries and indexing
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and data caching
- **Deployment**: Railway with containerized Gunicorn + PostgreSQL + Redis stack
- **Security**: SSL/TLS encryption, JWT authentication
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was handling high concurrent user loads while maintaining sub-second response times. This was solved through:

1. **Database Optimization**: Implemented strategic indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling
2. **Caching Strategy**: Deployed multi-layer caching with Redis for frequently accessed data
3. **Async Processing**: Offloaded heavy operations to Celery workers to keep API responses fast
4. **Monitoring**: Built custom observability middleware to track performance metrics and identify bottlenecks

## Outcome

The platform now serves multiple institutions with:
- **99.9% uptime** maintained through robust infrastructure
- **Sub-second response times** for all critical operations
- **10× throughput** compared to initial implementation
- **Scalable architecture** ready for horizontal scaling
