## Overview

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline hospital operations, including patient record management, appointment scheduling, doctor management, and administrative workflows.

## Key Features

- **Patient Management**: Complete patient record system with medical history, prescriptions, and treatment tracking
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Intelligent booking system with conflict detection and automated reminders
- **Doctor Portal**: Dedicated interface for doctors to manage appointments, view patient records, and update treatment plans
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive administrative panel for managing hospital resources, staff, and operations
- **Record Management**: Secure storage and retrieval of medical records with role-based access control
- **Reporting System**: Generate various reports for administrative and medical purposes

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django with Django ORM
- **Frontend**: AngularJS for dynamic single-page application
- **Database**: MySQL with optimized schema design
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication with custom role-based permissions
- **API**: RESTful API design for frontend-backend communication

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Query Optimization**: Implemented strategic indexing and query optimization techniques
2. **Caching Implementation**: Added caching layer for frequently accessed data
